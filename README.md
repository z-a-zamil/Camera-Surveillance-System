# ***Camera-Surveillance-System***

  This is my **Undergraduate Studies** academic project for ***CSE299: Junior Design*** course.

## **Introduction**
  In our project, we will try to create a system where we will detect the face of anyone and show their Name, Designation, and ID as output. The main objective of our project is to see people through face detection and display their information.

## **Problem Statement**
  1. Reduce Trespassing
  2. Identify detailed information from one's face. 

## **Project Description**
### ***templates***
  This folder contains all **HTML webpages and JavaScript** ( ***.html, .js*** ) files as needed.
### ***static***
  This folder contains all **CSS and Image / Icon** files ( ***.css, .ico, .jpge, .jpg, .png*** ) as needed. 
### ***main.py***
  All necessary codes are implemented here. The description for this code will be completed later on ðŸ™‚. 

## **Technologies Used**
  * Pycharm IDE
  * Python
  * Python - Flask
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * MongoDB (Online storage Database)
  * OpenCV
  * JavaScript

## **Conclusion**
  This project can be used for surveillance in any institute. It will register the face map along with their information. Then it will check the entry and exit of all members and whether they are valid members at that institute. If not, it will inform the security guard, and they can verify them manually through the previously existing process.
